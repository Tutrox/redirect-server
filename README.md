# redirect-server
Small server that uses MongoDB for redirecting. Can be used as an self-hosted shortlink service for example.

**TODO**: Create an interactive UI to manage the server with.

## Usage

There's a small setup needed to get the server up and running...

### `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the server root directory. Set these values (_example below_):

```sh
# Base configuration
RS_NAME=Development
RS_PORT=2000
RS_DATABASE=mongodb://localhost/rs-development
# Management
RS_SECRET=realsecret
RS_ADRESS=http://myserver.com
RS_MANAGEMENT_PATH=manage
# Update checking
RS_UPDATE_GITHUB=T0k3n
RS_UPDATE_WEBHOOK=https://myhook.com/catch
# Other options
RS_ROOT_NAME=root
```

- `RS_NAME` is the name for the server, use anything you like
- `RS_PORT` is the port where the server runs on, there's no default value built in!
- `RS_DATABASE` is the MongoDB connection URL
- `RS_SECRET` is a secret for JSON Web Tokens (_more later_)
- `RS_ADRESS` is the full adress for the server
- `RS_MANAGEMENT_PATH` (optional, default is `rs`) is the path for internal pages like the info page (`http://yourserver.com/{RS_MANAGEMENT_PATH}/info`)
- `RS_UPDATE_GITHUB` (required if `RS_UPDATE_WEBHOOK` is specified) is a GitHub private access token to authenticate with the GitHub API, which is used to get the current version of `redirect-server`. The token is needed to not hit the rate limits in the API and it does not need any extra permissions.
- `RS_UPDATE_WEBHOOK` is the URL where new updates should be notified to
- `RS_ROOT_NAME` (optional, default is `index`) is the redirect name for the root URL (`http://yourserver.com/`)

### MongoDB

The redirects should be saved to MongoDB to the **`redirects`** collection. Every entry looks like this:

```json
{
  "path": "example",
  "destination": "http://example.com",
  "type": 307
}
```

- `path` is the server path, so in this case the redirect would happen when visiting `http://your-redirect-server.com/example`
- `destination` is the URL where to redirect the user
- `type` is the HTTP status code, recommended codes are 301 (permanent) and 307 (temporary)

### Server-side cache

`redirect-server` uses an in-memory cache that will reset when the server restarts. In the case that you want to clear the case for **one** path without restarting the server, you have to do this:

- Sign a JSON Web Token using the secret in `RS_SECRET` (**security**: make sure that the JWT expires in a short time)
- Send a **`DELETE`** request to `http://your-redirect-server.com/{RS_MANAGEMENT_PATH}/cache/<PATH>`
  - Use this query string: `token=<YOUR JSON WEB TOKEN>`

So if we want to reset the cache for the example redirect that we created earlier we send a `DELETE` request to `http://your-redirect-server.com/rs/cache/example?token=jU5tANex4mplEt0ken`.

#### When should the cache be emptied?

The primary reason is if you have **updated** a redirect in the database. `redirect-server` will not notice this if the redirect is in the internal cache.
